- **Backend:** Electron 28 (main + preload + renderer)
- **State:** Zustand stores (app, task, chat, social, content, agent, sessions)
- **Database:** JSON file (`mega-agenda.json`) persisted to `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/`; reads AgentsView SQLite for session analytics
- **AI:** Multi-provider LLM support — Claude API (Sonnet 4.5 / Haiku 4.5 / Opus 4.6), Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter
- **Embeddings:** @xenova/transformers with MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim, ~22MB, cached locally)
- **Search:** Hybrid — LanceDB vector + MiniSearch BM25, merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60)
- **Terminal:** node-pty + xterm.js
- **Speech:** Local Whisper via @xenova/transformers (migrating from Web Speech API, which is unsupported in Electron 28)
- **Twitter:** Twitter API v2 (OAuth 1.0a for posting, bearer token for reading)
- **Bank Sync:** SimpleFIN Bridge (16K+ banks via MX) + Teller (direct connections)
- **AgentsView:** Session analytics via HTTP proxy to AgentsView (localhost:8090) + direct SQLite reads for insights

### Data Storage
- **JSON DB:** `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/mega-agenda.json` — tasks, categories, notes, stats, settings, conversations, drafts, goals, memories, bank connections, bank accounts, transactions, agents, issues, heartbeat runs, cost events, routines, tweet patterns, score snapshots
- **Context files:** `~/.claude/memory/` — markdown knowledge base with domain folders and goal research
- **Master plans:** `~/.claude/master-plans/` — dated plan files
- **Vector DB:** `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/vector-db/` — LanceDB vector index for semantic search
- **BM25 index:** `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/bm25-index.json` — MiniSearch full-text index
- **Hash sidecars:** `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/vector-db-hashes.json` + `vector-db-session-hashes.json` — incremental indexing
- **Model cache:** `%APPDATA%/mega-agenda/models/` — cached MiniLM and Whisper models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mega-agenda.git
cd mega-agenda
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Portable EXE

```bash
npm run build
```

The executable will be in `release/`.

### Optional Setup
- **Claude API Key** — Required for AI features (chat, research, summaries, master plan). Set in Settings tab.
- **Multi-LLM Providers** — Optionally configure Gemini, Groq, or OpenRouter as alternative providers in Settings.
- **Twitter Credentials** — Required for tweet posting. Set bearer token for reading, OAuth for posting in Settings.
- **Claude Code CLI** — Install globally for CLI-first research and task launching: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **SimpleFIN Bridge** — $15/year for live bank sync. Sign up at [simplefin.org](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org), connect banks, paste setup token in Accounts tab.
- **AgentsView** — Optional. Install for session analytics in the Sessions tab. Runs at localhost:8090.

## Security

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers — strict in production, relaxed for Vite HMR in dev
- Shell command injection protection — CMD metacharacter escaping in terminal launchers, validated URLs for `shell.openExternal` (http/https/mailto only)
- HTML entity escaping in markdown renderer (XSS prevention)
- Path traversal checks on context file IPC handlers
- ASAR packaging enabled for production builds
- No hardcoded PII — all personal references genericized
